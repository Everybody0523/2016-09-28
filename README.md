In this class I'll continue with the important discrete random variables that have special names: geometric, negative binomial, Poisson, hypergeometric. 

We will revisit these distributions throughout the course as more properties of random variables are discussed. These introductions are not comprehensive.

Who knows how far I'll get in this class.
